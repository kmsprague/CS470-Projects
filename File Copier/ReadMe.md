# FileCopier

## Overview 
This program copies the contents of one file to another. When run, the program prompts the user for the names of the original and destination files. If there are any errors with finding or opening the files, an error message is displayed and the program is exited. The files must be in the same directory as the program and executable files so the program can see them. Once the two files are opened, the contents from the original are written into the destination file. If there are any errors copying the contents an error is thrown, the errno is displayed, and the program is exited. 

## How to Run
This program is written in C, meaning it will need to be copiled before it can be executed. If you have the GNU Compiler Collection installed, you can use the following command in terminal: 
> gcc main.c -o executable

In this example, the program can be run using the following command in terminal: 
> ./executable
